Welcome to wxPython's Project Phoenix! Phoenix is the improved next-generation
wxPython, "better, stronger, faster than he was before." This new
implementation is focused on improving speed, maintainability and
extensibility. Just like "Classic" wxPython, Phoenix wraps the wxWidgets C++
toolkit and provides access to the user interface portions of the wxWidgets
API, enabling Python applications to have a native GUI on Windows, Macs or
Unix systems, with a native look and feel and requiring very little (if any)
platform specific code.

For more information please refer to the
`README file <https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/blob/master/README.rst>`_,
the `Migration Guide <https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/docs/html/MigrationGuide.html>`_,
or the `wxPython API documentation <https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/docs/html/main.html>`_.

Archive files containing a copy of the wxPython documentation, the demo and
samples, and also a set of MSVC .pdb files for Windows are available 
`here <https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/release-extras/>`_.
