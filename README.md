# pyUX
-------
A unified UML based python User Experience/UI Toolkit
-------

We aim to bring a cross platform (X/U)ML based UI experience for
all developers.

We will eventually be bringing you a GUI to create these UI's and
hope for a low learning curve for new developers looking to either
create Native stand-alone desktop application or Native addons for
their webservices in python.

At the moment bindings with GTK will probably be preferred as we want
the project to be cross platform but in the future will provide a way
to use each platforms Native UI Elements whilest still keeping projects
cross platform.

- We will also need to have a way to create binary files or something
similar to a .jar file which will run on every platform and contain the
python runtime files. this may be achieved with dockr for the moment.
